Simple temperature converter web application written with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Converts efficiently between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales. Plenty of room for improvement, but a decent working baseline to build on. Scales well to any screen size. Portable across all modern browsers.
