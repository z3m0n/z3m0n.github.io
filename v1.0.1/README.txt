Last Modified: 6/6/19

Simple temperature converter web application with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Converts efficiently between Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin temperature scales. Plenty of room for improvement, but a decent working baseline to build on. Scales well to any screen size.

VERSION INFO:
First release of TempConverter using prompts to gather information. Will be hosting on Heroku.

Version 1.0.2 is in the works with input fields.

TO RUN:
Open index.html file in a browser. 
[ App should be portable across all browsers. ]

WORK IN PROGRESS:
- Implement do...while loop control for input mismatching
- Simplify functions: a bit clunky the way written 
- Rework using objects: TempObj(float temp, String scale)-except JS
- Work on front-end: layout, style, etc.

- Host on Heroku
